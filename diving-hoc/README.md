# diving-hoc

## scaffolging

```shell
npx create-react-app diving-hoc --template typescript
```

## during application development

Once inside the project folder, the following commands can be given.

### start in development mode

```shell
npm start
```

### bundle the application into static files for production

```shell
npm run build
```

## finally, to remove this tool and copy the build dependencies, configuration files and scripts to the app directory

```shell
npm run eject
```

Remember, however, that this last is an irreversible operation.
